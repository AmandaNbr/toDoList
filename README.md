# To **Do** List

## 💻 Overview
This project is a website that allows users to manage their to-do lists. Users can create multiple to-do lists, each with its own set of tasks. They can mark tasks as completed when they finish them.

I have designed the website to reflect my personality and give it a personal touch. Although it is a relatively simple project, the journey to complete it was quite challenging. I had to work on the backend, frontend, and create a Docker setup for them. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience to bring this project to life and enhance my skills in web development.

## 📝 Prototypes and Diagrams

### 🧾 Low fidelity prototype
The low fidelity prototype was developed in a paint website, it was the first idea that I had about the _To_ **Do** _List_ and I really liked of how the components where in the screen, so i kept this idea to improve it later.

### 🖼 High fidelity prototype
The high fidelity prototype was created on the Figma plataform. You can access it [clicking here](https://www.figma.com/file/Px6gwVcuklwYnQLIgdnTzm/ToDoList?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=LlhTCNA8YGHvXTeg-1).

Here it goes a brief preview of what's on Figma.
